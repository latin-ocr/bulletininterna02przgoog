This oompound ean be obtained easily by boiling the aleo
holio solution of tbe above obinoxalinederivative with piorylobloride.
It crystallises from aoetio aoid in red needles melting at 287-80, so-
luble with difficulty in aloohol‚ ether, bennone, ohloroform, but easily
soluble in eoeton. Alkalis take it up readily.

ean be obtained exaotly in the same manner as the not methyla-
