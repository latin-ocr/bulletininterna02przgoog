ly smelling fumes, which condensed to a colourless oily liquid²
which on standing in the air became brown and on being heated with
hydrochloric aeid gave ared powder. We concluded that the
substance produced was pyrrolinc and that chlorophyll may be pos-
sibly apyrroline derivative. Last year Neneki and Il) obtained froin
phyllocyanin cuprio aeetate by treating it with hydroiodie aeid and
phosphonium iodide a base which under the influencc of air gave
umbilin. The properties of the bose mentioned reminded me sorei-
bly of the substance we had obtained with Dr. Schunck by means
of the reaetien described above and l thought it interesting en-
ough to ascertain in what relationship the 'two subsannes, the ene
obtained by dry reduction the ether by hydreiodic aeid stand te eaeb
other. I hund, that the twa] substances were identieal. This is proved by
the following experimenta. 1 gr. phyllocyanin, obtained by E. Sebuneks
method was mixed with 10 gr. ol aine dust and the mixture heated
in aglaes tube. Vary soon there may bc noticed in the cold parts
of the tube oily drops of a liquid, which turns rapidly reddish
brown. After cooling the tube was extraeted with warm alcohol⁷ fil-
tercd, to the filtrate water added and filtcred again. A sample ol
the filtrate gave with mercurie chloride a white precipitata. The
remaining liquid was left to stand in the air3 after some
time a red colouration was noticeable and on closer examinatius
every fine red precipitata observed. By adding alcohol to this
mixture and boiling'up a reddisb brawa solation was obtained,
which on being examiued through the spectroseop shewed au absorp-
tion bandin lrontoftheFline. The addition of a s‹.›lution ofzinc chloride
inaleoholie ammonia caused agreen fluorescence and the liquid on
being again examined spectroscopically shewed also a band in
frent of F. These tests show, that the red colouring matter obtained
lrom phyllocyanin in the manner described above is identieal with
urobilin and that the volatile substance, obtained by heating phyl-
locyanin with zinc duat, cannot be anything else but haemopyrrol. ·
