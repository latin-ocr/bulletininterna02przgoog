The benzylether of bromoisatin-oxime

The renation between isatin and α benzyl hydroxylamine takes
plaoe already in the eold. ln order to complete it, however, we heated
the ingrediente just as stated in the foregoing example in a sealed,
tube for 2 hours. The purification of the benzylether has been
carried out exaetly as stated in the oase of isatinoxime benzylether.
