Isatis tinotoria contains, a· shown by Dr. E. Sohunok‚ asub-
stanoe whieh under eertain munditions aplits up yielding indigotin
and sugat. Some years ago, when engaged in the study of the eon·
stitution of gluoosides in general, I expressad the opinion that in·
diean is a gluooslde of indoxyl. an opinion whioh hes been proved
to be eorreet by Hoogewerff and ter Meulen in their brilliant experi-
mental researoh on Polygonum tinctorium). The authors have isolated
from this plant a crystallina body which is hydrolised under the
influenoe of aoids yielding gluoose and iudoxyl. whioh latter in its
turn is oxidised under the influenoe ot air giving indigetin.
About the same time B'eijerinok ²) had also paid attention to the ohe
mistry of indigo producing planta, and arrived at the conclusion
that not all these plants oontain the gluooside of indoxyl‚ but that
on the eontrary Isatis tinetoria does not oontain this gloroside at
alt, but free indoxyl. These results were very unexpeeted, especially
considering that Dr. Sohunolr, who for the flrst time put forward
the gluooside nature of ludicen, based his views upon results ob·
tained from the study of this plant.

Beijerinek support· his eontention by the following observa-
tions. If extracta of Indigofera leptostaohya or Polygonum tiuoto-
rium aro treated with isatin at elevated temperatura a formation
os indiruhin, tha oondensation produnt of indoxyl and isatin⁷ will
tetre plane only after treating the said extranta with aeide, the rdle
of these seids being to split up the praexisting gluooside into indo·
xyl and gluoose. Now, using an extractos Isatis tinotoria the forma·
tion of indirubin takes plaoe without previous treatment with aeide„
and it may be inferred from this taut, that Isatis tinotoria contains
free indoxyl and not a eompound of it.
