porphyrin solutions just past the Ῑιβ line, and a second just past the
thallium line. Ι was therefore induced to repeat these experiments
with phylloporphyrin and again found the two bands in exactly
the same position.

Mr. Schunck had also the kindness to examine his old platee
of the phylloporphyrin spectrum and found that tho two bands are
present, but they were not mentioned in his very interesting paper
on the subject. Concerning the double band past the Ιζβ line I have
been unable to find a split oven at considerable dilution, but it is quite
possible that 1 have not been luclry enough to just hit the correct
concontration. The second band in the more refrangible part of the
spectrum (past the thallium line) may be also found in the haema-
toporphyrin spectrum, but both bands are moved somewhat towards
the red end of the spectrum.

Acid solutions. As will be seen from the reproduction of
a photo taken on a spectrum plate of Messrs. Cadett und Neal, the
spectra caused by aoid solutions of mesoporphyrin and phyllopor-
phyrin are identical. ⁴

The acid haematoporphyrin solutions cause, as is well known,
also three bands, which are shifted slightly towards the red end.

In more concentrated aoid solutions all the three porphyrins
muse, in addition to the bands shown by the phot0‚ two very faint
bands in front of F. Ι

The absorption in the ultraviolet part is characterised in· the
case of haematoporphyrin and phylloporphyrin, as shown by 0. Α.
Schunck, by a band past the kb line. Mesoporphyrin shows exactly
the same band es phylloporphyrin.

The action of bromine on mesoporphyrin and
phylloporphyrin. The study of the behavionr of mesopor-
phyrin towards bromine had a special interest. As is well known,
the chief difference which characterises haematoporphyrin as com-
pared with phylloporphyrin is that the product obtained by the
action of bromine on the former lacks an absorption band in the
extreme visible red. It has been shown that mesoporphyrin resem-
bles phylloporphyrin still more closely than haematoporphyrin,
and it could therefore have been expected that ,bromomesoporphy-
rin“ would show the additional band which we missed in the spec-
trum of „bromohaomatoporphyrin“. These expectations have indeed
been justified, us will bc seen from the appended drawing showing
