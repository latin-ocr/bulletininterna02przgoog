2) The absorption spectra of phylloporphyrin ond haemstopor-
phyrin ere very much olibe, almost identical, no matter whether
examined in neutrol‚ hesic or aeid solvente. The sume holds good
of the spectra ef the corresponding zinc compounds ²). 3) To-
wards bromine ond nitrio aeid phylloporphyrin und heemateporphy·
rin behave very much eliket). 4) A base of the formula GSHfflN,
which may be eonverted inte urobiline by oxidetiom con be oh-
teined from haemin or haematoporphyrin end also from phyllecys-
nin, by treating these bodies with solutions of hydreiodic aeid in
presence of phosphonium iodidey.

The present peper is devoted to the oxidction products of
phylloporphyrin. These experiments were commenced es early es
three years ego, but the amount of the quite pure oxidstion pro-
duet necessary for c combustion has been obtained only in the
course of lust summer. The oxidotion of the blood colouring,r met-
ter hasbeen the object of very important studies by William Kus-
ter ⁵). The most importent result of those researches being the dis-
covery, that hsemin may be eonverted hythe aetion oi hichromic
aeid into ubody OSH9NO4, which undergoes achonge under the
influence of alkelies or acide becoming converted into s new corn-
peund ef the formula cefisos· These substonees stand in very
simple relationship to euch ether, nsmely the compound lest named
may be considered es en enhydride of the threebosic eeid and the
first as the corresponding imide, thus:

socon seesO sceuNH
oua-coeo ems-cos ebus-eos
socon uooou socen

The imide undergoes under certain conditione al'urther change,
it looses corbon dioxide end yields u new body of the formula
C7H9NO2, which according to Kttster might he identicsl with the
imide ef methyl-ethyl-maleie aeid:
