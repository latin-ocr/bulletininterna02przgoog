aeid. The solution was heated on a boiling water bath for ¹s2 honr,
diluted with water and neutralised by adding a solution of sodium·
hydrate. The precipitata obtained we dissolved in eone. hydroehlo-
ric aeid, diluted the solution by adding water, filtered off rome
undissolved substanees and precipitated the ps-indophenazine deri·
vative by adding an allrali. This procedure has been repeated three
times and finally the N-tolyl·ps-indophenazine crystallised repea-
tedly from aloohol. We obtained glistening brownish red needles
melting at 255—2bbb0, whieh were easily soluble in boiling aleo-
hol, with greater difficulty in benzene and ohloroform. The solu-
tions in ooneentrated auida possess a yellow or reddish brovvn oo·
lour, aooording to the ooneentration ol them.

The ohlorhydride of the base may be obtained by passing
a eunent of hydroohlorie aoid through its solution in benzene. It
represents a yellow erystalline pewder whioh dissociatos very easily
giving off hydroehlorio aoid.

xBra-N·tolyl-ps-indephenauina

has been obtained from bromoisatin by a method analogoua
to the foregoing one. It orystallises from nloohol in bronnish red
needlea melting at auo-291⁰, whieh dissolve easily in boiling al·
eohol‚ not so readily in beurene, ohloroform and aneton and with
difficulty in ether.
