some years ago by Dr. Schunok¹); his results did not agree with
those obtained by Beijerinclr‚ and I have been enabled tc clear up the
cause of the differences of these two observem. Beijerinclr's expe·
riment is carried out as follows. Fresh leaves of Isatis tinctoria are
thrown into boiling vvater and the mixture kept at the boil for some
minutos, filtered off and the filtrate treated at once with an aqueous
solution of isatin. Very soon there is formed a red precipitato,
which is collected on a filter, washed well with water and dried.
The colouring irratter obtained is next crystallised twice from boiling
acetio aeid. It does not diller in any respect from indirubin oh-
tained by Baeyer's synthesis and possessos the same composition
as will be seen from the following analysis.

Quite a different result is obtained when operating with dried
leaves, that is, when the conditione are observed which led Dr.
Schunck to the discovery of indican. loperated aa follows. Leaves
of Isatis tinctoria which wcre left tc dry first at ordinary tempe-
ratura and then in a water stove were pulverised and 'extracted
with boiling alcohol. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pres·
sure, the residue extraoted with boiling water. liltered and the fil-
trate hoiled with a solution of isatin. There was formed after
some time a darlr precipitato which was filtred off, washed with
boiling water, then with a dilute solution of caustic suda and
again with water. The dry colouring matter was next dissolved
in boiling phenol‚ filtered and the solution precipitated with ether,
qnickly filtered off and dried. The colouring matter which may
for the present 'bc called isatocyanin possesses the following pro-
perties. It represents a blackish brown powder easily soluble in
acetio aoid with a blue colom, with greater difficulty in alcohol
and ether, and insoluble in alkalis. In cono. sulphuric aoid it dis·
solves at first with a yellowish colour but after standing the solu·
tion turns blue. The following table contains some of the charac-
teristic reactions of indirubin and isatocyanin3 it will be seen that
the two colouring matters differ very materially in, many respecta.
