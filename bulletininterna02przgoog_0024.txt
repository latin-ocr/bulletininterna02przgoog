bly of the substance we had obtained with Dr. Sohunclr by means
of the reaction described above and I thought it interesting en-
ongh to ascertain in what relationship the two substances, the ono

the following experimenta. 1 gr. 11111111111111,1111111111 hy E. Sohuneks
ruet-hod was mixed with 10 gr. of zine dust 1111 111 mixture heated
in aglaes tube. Very soon there may be notieed in the oold parts
of the tube oily drops of a liquid, which turns rapidly reddish
hrown. After eooling the tube was extraeted with 111111 1111111111-
tered to the filtrate water added and liltered again. A sample of
the filtrate gave with mercurie chloride a white precipitato. The
remaining liquid was left 11 stand 11 111 111; after some
time a red eolouration was notioeable aud on closer examinatiou
a very line red precipitate observed. By adding aleohol to this
mixture aud boiling'up a reddish hrowu solution was obtained,
which on being examined through the spectroseop shewed an absorp-
tion band in lrontoftheFliue. The addition 111 solution 111111 ehloride
in aleoholic ammonia caused agreen fluoreseence and the liquid on
being again examined spectrosoopieally showed 1111 1 band in
front of F. These testa show, that the red eolouring matter obtained
from phylloeyanin in the manner described above is identieal with
nrobiliu aud that the volatile substance, obtained by heating phyl-
looyauin with sinodum, cannot he anything else hut haemopyrrol. ·
