sioal researohes of Dr. Sohunok, and further researohes are neees-
sary to olear up the nature of the substance which yields in the
presence of isatiu isatooyanin‚ as well aa to establish definitely Bei-
jeriuoh's contentum, that Isatis tinotoria does oontain free indoxyl.
Schunoh ¹) pointed out, that in ease Beijerinok's views were eorreot
an extraot of the leave of the plant ought to yield indigotin on pas·
sing air through it, ae a matter of feet he oould notioe no forma-
tion of the oolour. against Beijerinok's contentiori may be put still
another objeotion: that it is not impossible, that isatiu dissolved in
boiling water partly forms isatio aoid, the hydrogen ions of whieh
may eause hydrolytio aetion. One thing however to my mind has
been proved by the experiment of Beijerinek‚ namely that the indi-
goproduoing substunees present in Isatis on theone handand in
Indigofera and Polygonum tinet. on the other are not identieal,
although iudoxyl is the intermediate produnt in'all deses.
