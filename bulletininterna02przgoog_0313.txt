The formation of the eeoond ohloroinduphenunino in thin ro·
aetion, forenoou by theory, we did not entnblinh with certainty. We
euoooedod however in obtaining this neoond inumere in the following
mnuner. Similurly us ull o-amino-phenylhydroxyobinoxulinen hi·
therto examinud may be eonvertnd into the norrenpouding indophen·
arinen hy the eotion of hoiliug eundo aoid, no utuy eleo the two
mentioned nhloriuuted oompouudn. The inumere melting ut uhigher
temperatum gives under the said condition· a chloroindophenuzine,
whioh hasbeen found tohu identioal with the compouud formed
by condennation of ohloropheuylenediumiuo with inutin. The isomene,
on tho other hand, which molto ut a lower temperature given a ohdo-
roindopheunniue identioul with theone obtained, when unetylinetin
is brought to not upou chloro-o-phenyleuediemine.

Aoetyl-hromoisatin bohuvos in quite the same manner as uoe-
tylisutin, it yields when treated with o-diamines u mixture of in-
dophenonine derivativus und 0-uminophenylhydroxyohinuxulino de-
rivatives.
