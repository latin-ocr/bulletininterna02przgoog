however to prove this eontention definitely, we endeavoured to pre·-

the position of the olkyl or aryl introduced, and oompnre thern
with the substonees obteineble by the old¹ method. To this end we
oohdensod irntin with n-henzylhydroxylemine and eompared the thus
formed isatinoxirne bennyl ether with the produnt of internetion of
benzylohloride and isatinoxinie silver. This comparison hos shown.
that the two substantes are identiool and it follows therefrom, that
the others obtained by Baeyer's method are exygenethers, ond that
the constitution of the silver solt may be expressed hy one of
