the ooenosaro. Iu my complete paper the histology of the process
will be treated more fully. Itis not very different from the pro-
oess of hydrauth formation deseribed by Stevens (01). I should
state, however, that the first tentaole „Aulugen“ appear here first ou
the old wall of the stem and afterwards on the olosing membrana
After the formation of the tentaoles the hydranth emerges from
the porisaro by breaking through it The hydranth with a small
pieoe of the stem projeots at right angle from the perisaru. The
interpretation of this position is given by Mor gan (01) who eou-
sidere it as „the result of negative stereotropism“.

Driesehl) (00) has shown that pieoes from the oral end
of the stem produoe hydrauths in a shorter time than pieoes from
the more aboral parts. This faut whioh Ioould often ohserve for
the eroes-out pieoes oanuot be extended to those split lengthwise.

Itis known that the hydrauth in pieoes out orosswise deve-
lops at first at the anterior eud aud afterwards ahydrunth deve
lops also attho posterior end. The prooess ι of the development of
the hydrunth at the aboral end was discovered by Loeb²l who
gave the name heterornorphosis to this phenomeuon. But we
see iu the longitudinally split pieees that the hydrauth oau develop
often at first at the aboral end (heteromorphosis: Loeb, Mor gan)
or in several cases, ss I will describe later, iu the middle of the
' stem. Only when a very small part has been removed lengthwise
from the stem, does the latter produoe the hydrauth first at the
oral (anterior) end. Iu other oases the development of the hydranths
at the anterior and posterior eud is going on almost simultaueously
or at very short intervals from eaoh other. Iu many cases the
hydranth is formed only at one end.

Iu those oases iu whioh the stem is split leugthwise the
operation brings about, Ithinlr‚ somewhat diflerent internal cou-
ditions iu the living organism. This ohange oarries with it
Ι think, a ohange of the faetore that have a determining influenoe
ι upon the prooess of regeneratiou. Therefore the course of regene-

ration is here somewhat different from the prooess in pieees eut
across.
