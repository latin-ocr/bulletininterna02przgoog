drogen atum would cause the formation of a substance with absorp-
1166 hands moved towards the violet end of the spectrum, i. c. the
spectrum of mesoporphyrin will resemble even more that of phyllo-
porphyriu than does its mothersubstance‚ haematoporphyrin. The com-
parison of the spectra of mesoporphyrin and phylloporphyrin has
indeed shown that the difference between the two is infinitesimal,
scarcely measurable by methods hitherto applied iu such cases.

This result differs from the result oi Nencki aud Zaleshi ¹), inas-
much as these authors did not notice any differeuce in the ab·
sorption spectra of haematoporphyrin and mesoporphyriu. The pre-
paring of solutions of mesoporphyrin is somewhat tedicus, as this
substance when applied in the crystalline state dissolves in various
solvents only with great difficulty. Ifound this difficulty can bc
ovcroome in the following manner. Mesoporphyrin is dissolved in
alcoholio potash‚ 156 solution diluted with water, acidulated with
acetic acid and quickly extracted with ether. ’

Ι6 this manner strongly coloured solutions are obtained which
may be afterwards diluted as required.

The measurement of wavelengths obtained for the absorption
bands of equally strongly coloured solutions of phylloporphyrin and
mesoporphyrin ure as follows:

Phylloporphyrin Mesoporphyrin
Ι rouo-rom 1626-1622
Π tort-roro tols-roll
III λ 600 - λ 595 λ 601 - λ 596
IV λ 581 - λ 573 λ 582 - λ 573
V λ570-λ566 1572-λ567
VI λ 536 - λ 520 λ 537 - λ 522
VH λ 506 - λ 478 λ 508 - λ 479

The absorption of the violet and ultruviolet rays caused by
15666 two substances are also identioal. Phylloporphyrin has been
studicd in this respect before by my friend Mr. 0„ A. Schunck.

Ihave found in 156 spectrum of mesoporphyrin two hands,
156 position of oue of them corresponds exactly to the position of

the double band observed by Mr. Schunck in highly diluted phyllo-
