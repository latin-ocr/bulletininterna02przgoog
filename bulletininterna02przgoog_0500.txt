pieees are half-cylinders. There rernains usually more of the tissne

of the stem on one side than on the other. The process of forma-
tion of the cavity is dependent on the amount of substance in the
half-cylinder.

l. I will describe the process first in those cases in which
one piece is bigger than the other.

In the course of a few minutas one can see ¹) in the living
material that the two longitudinally cut-edges form new walls on
each side which grcw towards one another. The inner edges of
the new wall come together first in those regions where they were
less widely separated at the beginning. nectareis formed along
the line of meeting of the edges. The old cavity exposed by the
operation is closed by the union of two walls which form the clo-
sing membrana.

In many cases, not in all, I could see in the course of clo-
sing of the longitudinally-cnt sterne a circulation of the fluid within
the two walls that were closing in. This circulation takes
place within the enlarged swollen edges of the half-
cylinder and not in the cavity. After formation of the clo-
sing membrana the circulation can be seen in the united new walls
along the line of sutura. This circulation is in the beginning very
slight, bnt becomes later more distinct. When the closing of the
cavity is finished‚ i. e. when the edges are united and the closing
membrana is formed, the circulation disappears in the tissne around
the sature and can be seen soon afterwards
in the closed central cavity of the stem. g* ,ὁ x.
