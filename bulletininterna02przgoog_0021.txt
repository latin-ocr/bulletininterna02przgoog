ted with precipitated carbonate of calcium. As soon as the evo-
lution of carbon-dioxide eeased the undissolved carbonate was filte-
red off and the filtrate heated fora few minutos to the boiling
point. There was in this way produced a white precipitata, which prov-
ed to be the basic calcium salt of haematie aeid. The precipitate
I stirred into water, decomposed vvith some hydrochloric acid and
extracted the liquid with ether3 after evaporating the latter white
crystalls were obtained, which after two recrystallisations from as little
as possible water shewed the melting point of 9ee-9e0, that is
nearly the sameas given by Khster for his enhydride of haema-
tie aeid. In all 08 gr. of the substance has been obtained:

ln order to get further proofs of identity of this substance
with Kusters aoid, Ob gr. were dissolved in water, neutralised with
ammonia and precipitated with silver nitrete. The amorphous white
precipitato gave the following results on being analysed:

The properties of the oxidation prodnet of phylloporphyrin de-
scribed viz. its melting point, is compositiony the readiness to give
a basio calcium salt and the composition of the silver salt make it
evident‚ that the oxidation of phylloporpbyrin by means of bichro-
mate of sodium leads to a substance identical with the enhydride
of the threebasie haematic aoid, obtained under similar conditione
from haemin, haematoporphyrin and bilirobin.
