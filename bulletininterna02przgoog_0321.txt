o-Hydroxy-2-phenyl-3-hydroxy-l(6)-ohloro-
ehinoxaline.

In order to obtain this ornnponnd we prooeeded as follows:
15 gr. of isatin were eonverted into isatis aeid under conditione
previously related ¹), and diazotised in the well known manner. 'l’he
diaaobody was next eonverted into o-hydroxy-benaryl-formio aoid
by boiling it with a diluted solution of sulphuris aeid and finally
the o-hydroxy-benzyl-formio aoid isolated by extraction with ether.
The condensation with o-ehlorophenylenediamine takes place easily
at the temperatura of the boil of the aqueous solutions of the re-
aeting bodies. The ohinoxaline oompound obtained was finally puri—
fied by erystallising from aloohol. We obtained yellow needles‚

Sulphonio aoid of o-hydroxy-2-phenyl-3-hydroxy-
-r(-6)- ehloroehinoxaline

⁴ is formed by hasting the sulphurio aeid solution of the ehi-
noxaline oompound on the water bath. The formerly dark reddish
brown solution ehanges gradually its eolour to a yellow one. The pro·
duot of sulphonation ean be isolated by pouring the warm sulphurie
aeid solution into water and adding sodium ehlorida The sodium
salt formed ean be purified by crystallising from boiling water. It
eontains three rnoleeules of water of crystallisation:
