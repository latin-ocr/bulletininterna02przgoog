It has bee‘n' already shown by one of usin eserico of pa·
perol) publiehed jointly with Messrs. Redoliffc, Buraczewslri and
Sosnowski, that aoetylisctin reacts with odiaminea producing in-
dophenazines and derivatives of phenylhydroxychinoxaline. This
has been proved for the following odiaminen: o-pheuylenediamine,
p-ethoxy- o-phenylenediamine and p-methyl-o-phenylenediamine. The
o-amino-phonylhydroxychinoxalines reaot with nitrous aoid in every
peculiar manner producing representatives os a new group of poly-
cyclio bodies, which have been called cumarophenazines and which
have been aleo obtained by heating the baryum saltn of sulphonic
acida, produced by sulphonating o-hydroxy-phenyl-hydroxyohinoxa-
linea The latter are formed by condensing o-diamines with o-hy-
droxybenzoylformic aoid.

With o-diemines containing a secondary amine gronp isatin
reacte quite differently, it yields derivatives of ps-indophenazine.

This peculiar behavionr of isatin induced us to strrdy the
reactions mentioned using still other diamines and the results ob-
tained fully endorse the former trials.

Acctylisatin reacts with p-chloro- o-phenylenediaminc yielding
acctyl-chloro-indophenazine‚ and a mixture of two isomeric o-acet
emino-phenyl-hydroxy-chlorochinoxelines. The latter gives after aa·
ponificationtwoiaomericcamino-phenyl-hydroxy-chloro-chinoxsalines,
which can be separated utilising their unoqual solubility in alcohol.
These reactionn may be expressed by the following formulae:
