two renent pepere hy Mergane but, Ι thinh7 it hes not yet been
sufficiently examined. We do not find in the literature the hietolo-
gioul study of this prooese. Morgen (02) says in his eeoond pe·

oouree of e few minutee the ooenoeero withdrawe slightly from

eetoderm on its outer end endoderm on ite inner eurfeoe“.

The development of hydronths, when the stem ie out longi-
tudinelly‚ ie eleo not suffieiently deseribed. It wee mentioned by
Drieeoh (97) end Morgen (01). But Morgen himself stated his
experiment were not complete ⁴).

This work wee done during my stay et the Neplee Zoologi-
oel Station.

In my experimento the stem of tubulerio was eut in two lon-
gitudinelly. Two half-oylindere were
obtained in this wey. They ere oom-
posed of the perienro (hg. 1. p) on the
outer end eoenosero (fig. 1. o) (eete-

derm end endoderm) on the inner

eurfeoe. The oentrel oevity of the stem
rs now open.
The first prooeos whioh we oen

ohserve is the formation of the new

eevity. This prooem ie notin all oeses n prooese of olosing over

of the old oevity but ae we shall see sometimes e new oevity is
formed.
