’ ectoderm begins to overgrow the endodermal cells which are ar-

ranged in several layers3 soon afterwards this endodermal tisana
becomes surrounded by the octodermal layer. The process of the
disintegration and the productiori of the globnles begins at several
places in the endodermal layer (fig. 8), while the overgrowth is
taking plaee. Later a circulation of the globules appears, and the
cavity srising from degeneration of several cells becomes wider
At last only two layers bonnding the

cavity remain: the endodermal cells

number of endoderrnal cells in the early
stages of formation? An examination
of these pieces of the stem after the
formation of the new eavity gives evidence in favour of the view
that the arrangement in several layers of the endoderm is the result
of the migration of the cells from oral aad aboral end to the middle
part of the picce3 we find at both ends only the perisarc while the
coenosarc was accumulated in themora central part of the half-
cylinder (comp. Morgana (01) fig. 25, p. 52). The new cavity
which is formed in these cases is not the old cawity closed by the
regenerativa process, butan entirely new canal which is formed
from the tabularian stem.

If the stem of tabularia is split lengthwise into unsymmetri-
cal pieoes which have in ona place narrower, in another place broader
walls, the manner of the formation of the cavity is dependent on
the relative thickness of the different regions. The closing in the
different regions follows one or the otber of the precedent methods
of elosare according to the breadth of the region.
