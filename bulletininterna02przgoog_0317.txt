,ft-DN, -— Obloroindophenanine

⁸ has been obtained by the following method. 20 gr. of aoetylisatin
were dissolvsd in hot aestio aoid and a corresponding quantity of
obloroo-pbenylenodiamius oblorhydrato and aestate of sodium added.
After sometime apreoipitats hasbeen formed3 without filtering
off the latter, water has besu added, tho mixture rendered oikalino,
boiled for 15 minutos and siltered. Tho insoluble part represents
d·ohloroindophenanine, whioh is purified by orystallisatiou from
noetio aoid. Obtained yellowish needles melting at 310⁰, solublo
with diffioulty in aoetio aoid. very little solubls in 01001101, benzene

aoeton and other. ’

morio o·aostamino-phsnyl-hydroxyohloroohinoxalinos dissolved in
cono. hydroohlorio aoid and the solution hsated on a water bath for
six hours. After that the solution was diluted with water, 1111111011,
neutralised by adding an alkali. In order to separato the two iso-
merieo-amino-pbenyl·hydroxy-ohloroohinoxalinoatheprooipitatemen-
tionsd is crystallised from aloohol. The more soluble part melting

boiled with giaoial aestio aoid. It is easily soluble in aeeton with
1111110011γί111101110110,0111010101111 and other. Its solution in cone.
hydroobiorio aoid gives a red eoloration with other. The hydroohlo-
