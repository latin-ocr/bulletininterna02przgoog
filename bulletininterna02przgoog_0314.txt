chinoxeline. 'Phe letter hae been obtained by condenring chloro-ephe-
nylenadiamine with hydroxybenaoyl sormic aoid.

We dont consider the above result by any means aa a proof
for the hydroxyl-formula ior isatin on the contrary we think it
highly probable, that the above reaction takes place in two stages
producing first an imeoatin‚ containing ehydroxyl group, which
iaeplit off afterwards with the hydrogen atorn oi the secondery
amine group to cloec the ezine ring.

The beheviour of isatin towards hydroxylamine hee been
studied on several occasions before, it nemeina however still unde-
cided by which formula to express the constitution of the ethera
oi isatinoxime.

These ethera may be obtained according to Baeyers method
by the aetion of alkylhaloide on the ailver salt of the exime and,
leed by analogy. one of the following formulae may appear ec-
cepteble:
