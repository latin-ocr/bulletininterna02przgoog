The walls do not grow towards one another forming a crosa bridge
over the old oavity, but we see here a gradual thiokening os the
whole old wall, Simultaneously a wideuing of the iuuet cimai of

Six or neven hours after operntiug, the two thiekenings which take

line of the buttem os the half- eylinder, forming by the uniou of
the two canals n single eavity. The entire process may be observed
in the living material.
