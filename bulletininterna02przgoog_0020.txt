The said transformation 01 haematoporphyrin takes place
judging by Kttster's description, very easily and Iboped there·
fore, that even the oxidation of small quantities of phylloporphyrin
at my disposal might lead to positive results. These hopes have
been justified as will be shown in the course of this paper.

1 used phylloporphyrin which contained 0 small admixture 01

00010 other substance. probably phyllorubin. Its solution caused
a faint band in the red part of the spectrum, which is not shown
by pure phylloporphyrin. 11 has been prepared from phyllocyanin3
the latter vves convertsd into phyllotaonin by treatment with an
alhali and then heated in a solution of 010011011000100111019111111
0001011 tubes. The crude produot obtained has been purified by al-
cohol. which dissolves chiefly phylloporphyrin leaving other substan-
ces undissolved. Not quite 5 gr. 01 the preparation obtained were dis-
solved in 500 001Β 01 glacial 000110 aoid, 41 gr. of biohromate of
sodium, dissolved in a little water, added and the whole heated on
the water bath as long as 0 sample drawn gave the chromic aoid
reaction distinctly. As soon 00 the latter test became but faint the
eoetic aoid was distilled 011. 01 first by direct dame, afterwards
on awater bath under reduced pressure. The residue Ι treated with
an amount of sulphuric acid necessary to decompose the acetates

times with ether. The joint extracts were evaporated to dryness and
0 mass obtained, which at first thick and oily became after stan-
ding crystallina. Assuming, that similarly 00 10 the case of haema-
toporphyrin two substanoes were formed, namely the imide and an·
hydride of the threebasio 1100010110 aoid Ideoided, in order to sim-
plify matters, 10 decompose the imide· and 10 obtain if possible the
enhydride named and identiiy it. With this end in view Idissol-

bonata of sodium and left the solution at rest lor 24 hours after
which time the mass 1100 been acidulated with sulphuric aeid and
again extracted with ether. The ethereal extract gave 00 evapora-
