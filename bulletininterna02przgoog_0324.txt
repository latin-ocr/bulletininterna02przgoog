0o isatis-oxiam 0111010 arrd derivatives,

These substances may be obtained, as already pointed out,
by two different methodo. Τ110 11101 00001010 10 heating 1110 silver
saltos 1110 exime with 00 alkylhaloide and the second in conden-
sing 100110 with α alkyl-hydroxylamine.

Benzylether 01 matio-oxima.

First method. The silver salt 01 lectio-oxima, which has
been obtained according to Baeyer’s prescription‚ we heated with ben-
aylchloride in presence of alcohol on 0 00101ζο0011010000101110010.

with some charcoal liltered again and 101110 0001. Τ110 011101 crystal-

lised 0011010101 01 yellow needles3 these were purified by several
recrystallisations from alcohol.

Second method.

1.4 gr. isatin and the aequimolecular quantity of 1110 hydro-
chloride of α benzyl hydroxylamine and sodium carbonate were 1100-
ted in alcoholic solution in 0 0001οἀ tube for three hours 01 100⁰.
Τ110 00010010 011110 tube were then treated with caustio soda in order
to remove 1110 unaltered isatin and the part undissolved therein crys-
tallised twice from alcohol. The yield is almost quantitative. The
product obtained did 001 show any differcnoes when compared with
the one obtained by the first method.
