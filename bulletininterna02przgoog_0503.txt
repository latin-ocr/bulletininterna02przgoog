neously on both sides. The inner walls (fig. b. a) of the oanale (a)
which grow dovnwards reaoh the median line, unite and form
from the two separate eanale a single eavity (fig. 6). During the
whole of this process the oovering eotoderm grows down more
slowly than the endoderm.

The olosing membrano extende parallel to the old wall of the
stem. Itis olear that the stem retains in these eaees the form of
the half-oylinder even after the complete eloaing of the eavity
(fig. 6).

lt may be asked, Where does the material oome from for
the formation of the olosing membrana?

For the formation of the first walls at the edges of the ooeno-
earo the material arises from the endodermal layer. After formation
of the eanal within the wall the further process involves the dis-

plaoernent of the eoenosaro in the direotion whioh is indicated in
diagram ἵ). bytho arrow. This observation accounts also for the
faet that in these cases, after the formation of the definitive oevity
has taken place, the wltole coenosam lies often in the bottom of
the half-cylinder. The edges of the perisara are prominent on both
sides of the coenosam (fig. 6). Karyokinetio division does not take
plaoe during the formation of the eavity.

3. In those oases in whioh the half-oylinder is very thin aad
contains very little of the living substanoa the endodermal eells
aooumulate soon after tlte operation and form several layers over—
lying the primitive endoderm (fig. 7). The oells in these endodermal

layers have osten very different forms from those ol the primitive
endoderm. I think it very pmbable that this differenoe of form ean
be explained by the amoeboid movements whioh the oells have
executed.

In the following stages (122 hours alter the operation) the
