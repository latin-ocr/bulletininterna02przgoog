ted with precipitated carbonate of calcium. As soon as the evo-
lution of carbon-dioxide eeased the undissolved carbonate was filte-
red off and the filtrate heated fora few minutas to the boiling
point. There was in this way produced a white precipitata which prov-
ed to be the basio calcium salt of haematic aeid. The precipitata
I stirred into water, decomposed with some hydrochlorie aeid and
extraeted the liquid with ether3 after evaporating the latter white

as possible water shewed the melting point of auh-96⁰, that is
nearly the same as given by deter for his anhydride of haema-
tie aeid. In all aa gr. of the substance has been obtained:

The properties os the oxidation produet of phylloporphyrin de-
scribed via. its melting point, its composition, the readiness to give
a basie calcium salt and the composition of the silve-r salt make it
evident, that the oxidation of phylloporphyrin by means of bichro-
mate of sodium leads to a substance identieal with the enhydride
of the threebasie haematic aeid, obtained under similar conditions
from haemin, haematoporphyrin and bilirubin.
