nection with the reat of the atem. Within the vesicle the circu-
lation of the globulea may be acen very distinctly. On the oppo-
site ride of the thin region tentacle „Anlagen“ appear aluo (fig. 103)
acon afterwards. Ι could observe the contractione of the coenoaarc
at intervals ofa few minutae, and during one ol its contractione
the connection between two hydranth „Anlagen“ was broken anthat
two separate hydranth· were formed (fig. ll). The process of for-
mation of the hydrantha and the connection of the coenoaarc take
place within the perisarc (fig. ll np.) which ia produced by the
ectoderm of the olosing membrane. The contractione of the coeno-
aarc observed before the breaking of the atem within the periaarc
brought positive proofs that the morphological connection between
the pericarc and coenosarc at the region of the hydrantha forma-
tion ie broken.

‚In the next stages after complete development of the tenta-
clea the hydrantha break through tho periearc and emerge through
the two aperturea.

The development of the hydranth in the center of the atem
is, l think, not without importance. Itis a proof that the process
of formation of the hydranth can take place while the continuity

of the atem ia not broken. The hydrantha which are formed by
the piecea cut longitudinally have a reduced number (9-16) of
tentacles.

The hydranths of the piccea cut longitudinally break off after
2 to ὃ days (antotomy). In come casea the breaking off of the li-
ving hydrantha takes place, in other casea the hydrantba die and
subsequently become broken off. In the place of broken hydranthe

a new head regenerateo after 3 to 4 days, and the number of ita
tentacles ie still more reduced. I have never observed the regene-
ration of the hydranth a third time which often occurs in piecca
cut croeawise.
