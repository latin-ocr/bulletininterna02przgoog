tere extracted 11011 the gall, and their derivativae, which, with the
exception 01 urobilin, do not cause any characteristic absorption in
the visible part of the spectrum, will cause in the more 111111-
gible part bande, eimihar to chlorophyll and haemoglobin or their
derivativas. Our investigatione do not confirm this supposition.

Neither bilirubin, or umbilin and biliverdin studied in various
solvente cause any characteristic absorption bande in the ultraviolet.
Protainchrom which might be, according to Neneki’s hypothesis, the
mothereubetance 01 the blood colouring matter behaved similarly.
This result alters, to a certain extent, the conclusione drawn 11011
the very important reeearches 01 Hartley. It seems that the absorp
tion 01 ultraviolet raye does not in the 11111 instance depend upon
the constitution of the nucleus forming the base 01 complicated
substances, but is caused rather by certain atomio groups, which
may not bc present in all the derivativas 01 the same mothcrsub·
etance. This explains the mally different behaviour 01 urobilin and
phylloporphyrin or haematoporphyrin. The next conclusion to be
drawn ie that urobilin, which ie formed 10 easily hy oxidation 01
