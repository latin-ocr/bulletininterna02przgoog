tion acrystalline mass, which was dissolved iu cold water and trea-
ted with precipitated carbonate of calcium. As soon as the evo-
lution of carbon-dioxide ceased the undissolved carbonate was filte-
red off aud the filtrate heated for a few minutas to the boiling
point. There was in this way produced a white precipitate, which prov-
ed to bc the basic calcium salt of haematic aoid. The precipitate

extructed the liquid with ether3 after evaporating the latter white
crystalla were obtained, which after two rccrystallisations from as little
as possible water shewed the melting pointel eoo-96⁰, that is
nearly the same as given by Khstcr for his enhydride of haema-
tic aeid. In all 08 gr. of the substance has been obtained:

ln order to get further proofs of identity of this substance
with Khsters aoid, Ob gr. were dissolved in water, neutralised with
ammonia and precipitated with silver nitrate. The amorphous white

The properties of the oxidation product of phylloporphyrin de-
scribed viz. its melting point, is composition, the readiness to give
a basio calcium salt and the composition of the silver salt make it
evident, that the oxidation of phylloporphyrin by means of bichro-
mate of sodium leads to a substance identical with the enhydride
of the threebasic haematic aeid, obtained under similar conditions
from haemin, haematoporphyrin and bilirubin.
